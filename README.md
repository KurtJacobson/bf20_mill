 # BF20 Mill Gui

This is a GUI developed for an Optimum BF20 mill that has been converted
to cnc. I suspect this will work okay for similar machines or anything
that is not all decked out with an ATC of some form.

## Credits
There are some MASSIVE credits I need to and want to call out here:
[1] jethornton   https://github.com/jethornton/mill_touch_v6
I basiclly started as a tutorial a ground up build of his excellent gui.
In the end (under the MIT license) I re used a couple of his python code
files.  I could have rebuilt them but it was silly and my result would
have ended up looking almost exactly the same.
Also for the questions answered and the patience in answering them.

[2] hazzy for the support/questions answered on the most excellent qtpyvcp.
Also for the patience shown for what must have seemed like an endless
list statements that all summarise into "how does this work".

[3] kcjengr https://github.com/kcjengr/probe_basic
Used probe-basic to help understand how things work and also have made
temp use of some probe icons. Plan being to replace them in some manner
once I get enough done.
